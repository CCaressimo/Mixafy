# Mixafy

## A backend driven application that utilizes a hand built database that stores songs with the proper information and links from Spotify. 

### This app allows the user to generate random playlists between selected genres or one specific genre from a database of handpicked songs from Spotify. By using SQL commands, we are able to fetch embed links from the Database to populate the front end.

### Mixafy utilizes Express, Sequelize, and Bootstrap.
